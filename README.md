## 🧩 Overview  

**LuLu for macOS** is a next-generation firewall application built to monitor and block unauthorized network activity on your Mac. Designed for users who value privacy and control, LuLu provides clear visibility into which applications attempt to connect online and lets you decide what’s allowed or denied — in real time.  

Unlike complex enterprise firewalls, **LuLu** focuses on simplicity and transparency. It alerts you whenever a new or unknown process tries to send data, giving you complete authority over your system’s internet connections. This ensures that background processes or hidden apps can’t transmit information without your approval.  

Optimized for **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)** and Intel-based Macs, LuLu runs efficiently in the background with minimal system impact. Its user-friendly interface makes it accessible even to non-technical users while maintaining advanced features like persistent rules, logging, and integration with macOS security frameworks.  

Perfect for journalists, developers, or privacy-conscious users, LuLu provides peace of mind that every outgoing connection is secure, visible, and entirely under your control.
